This provides a simple function for calculating the centroid (mean) point for a set of arbitrary points in N-dimensional space.

It is also a super good listener, but isn't one to contribute to a conversation ðŸ™‚

OK, that last bit is made up, but it does do the whole centroid point calculation. Enjoy!
